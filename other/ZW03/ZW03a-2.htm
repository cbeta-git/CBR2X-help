<p class="head">FOREWORD</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Two years and a 
half have elapsed since we began to prepare for editing the <i>Buddhist Texts 
Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i> in the summer of 1994, and now we have 
successfully presented the third number to our dear readers. Since the 
publication of the first number of our book, we have received many letters from 
our readers both at home and abroad. Some have extended fervent support to our 
work; some have afforded us fresh information concerning Buddhist texts not 
contained in the Tripitaka; some have put forth emendatory suggestions on our 
collated texts; and the others have sent us some supporting funds, hoping that 
we can insist on doing this significant work. I hereby would like to express, on 
behalf of the whole staff of this editorial board, our heartfelt thanks to our 
readers who have been concerned with the growth of this series of books; to the 
Institute of Chinese Buddhist Culture, the Zhi Lian Jing Yuan from Hong Kong, 
the General Corporation of Buddhist Cultural Establishments at Shanxi Province, 
and other related units and individuals that have rendered great support to the 
publication of this series of books.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The following is 
a brief introduction of the main content of the third number of the <i>Buddhist 
Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>:</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The column &quot;Chan 
Texts from Dunhuang&quot; publish two Chan texts from Dunhuang.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The <i>Pu Sa 
Zong Chi Fa</i> was written by a foremost exponent of the Huineng (638-713 AD) system in the Southern 
Chan School, and it has some substantial similarities with the <i>Guan Xin Lun</i> 
ascribed to Bodhidharma (?-536 AD); therefore, the 
relationship between the two texts has yet to be further studied. The text was 
first discovered by Mr. Ryogho TANAKA, a Japanese scholar, from the special 
collection of Dunhuang in France, and he published his copied text and studies. 
The text here has been <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「recollated」，按前後文義修訂作「re-collated」。">
re-collated</span>, in accordance with the layout of the <i>Buddhist Texts Not 
Contained in the Tripitaha</i>, by both Mr. Daishun UEYAMA , a noted Japanese 
Buddhist scholar, and Mr. YUAN Deling, a young research fellow with the Chinese 
Institute of Dunhuang Studies, with reference to another transcript of the text 
newly discovered in the Beijing Library. Hence a new collated text to our 
readers. The Dunhuang studies has already become a worldwide branch of learning, 
and the collation of the Dunhuang texts as a matter of course needs constant 
improvement. Consequently, we welcome related scholars of various countries to 
engage in collating the Buddhist texts among the surviving books from Dunhuang, 
welcome them to make further efforts to better the collated ones so that we can 
make a good job of these cultural undertakings of mankind. Those who have been 
engaged in this work are also welcome to publish their research achievements in 
this aspect in the <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaha</i>.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>The Da Cheng 
Qi Shi Lun</i> was also written by a foremost exponent of the Huineng system in 
the Southern Chan School. More seasoned was the ideology of the Southern Chan 
School reflected in the text, and more incisive the author's style. Now that the 
text was copied when Dunhuang was under the reign of ancient Tibet, it probably 
dates from the first half of the 8th century AD. The readers will surely feel 
this text very familiar who know such Chan texts of later ages as the <i>Wu Deng 
Hui Yuan</i>. This shows that some traits of the Southern Chan School can be 
traced back to the age when this text was produced and is no doubt of great 
significance to the studies of the Chan School. I <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「oftenponder」，按前後文義修訂作「often ponder」。">
often ponder</span> over such a question: Has the Chan School after all raised 
the Buddhist theory to an unprecedented new height or has it driven the Buddhist 
theory into an undevelopable dead end? So far I have not come to a conclusion 
yet. Therefore, this text has furnished fresh material for us to trace back the 
developmental process of the Chan School ideology.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">In the coming 
numbers of the <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>, we shall 
continue to make efforts to collate the Chan texts from Dunhuang, and friends 
from various circles are welcome to give us guidance and support.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The column 
&quot;Commentaries on the Tripitaka&quot; brings forth seven texts.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The first 
fascicle of the <i>Jing Ming Jing Ji Jie Guan Thong Shu</i>, collected by Daoye 
in the Tang Dynasty
(618-907 AD), 
was published in the second number of this series of books, and we now bring 
forth the second fascicle of the text. As the &quot;Foreword&quot; to the second number of 
our book says, in spite of the fact that the text has been collected into the 
85th volume of the <i>Dazhengzang</i>, more than 10 thousand Chinese characters 
from the latter half of <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書有「of 」，按前後文義刪除。"></span>
the 5th pin
(chapter) to the 
first half of the 7th pin have been missing, and the selected master copy was 
not very good and lacked relatively serious collation. As it happens, the second 
fascicle of the text published in this number contains the part the <i>
Dazhengzang</i> 
has lost, and I am assured that it will arouse our readers' interest. Careful 
readers may notice that, in the second fascicle of the text published in this 
number, we have corrected a number of wrongly written Chinese characters found 
in the <i>Vimalakirtinirdesasutra</i> contained in the <i>Dozhengzang</i>. Such 
an important scripture as the <i>Vimalakirtinirdesasudra</i>, handed down for 
more than one thousand years, collected into the Dazangjing, has undergone 
collation by numerous people through the ages, and yet the text included in the 
Dazangjing, unfortunately, contains some wrongly written Chinese characters. In 
addition to the <i>Vimalakirtinirdesasutra</i>, texts such as <i>the 
Saddharmapundarikasutra</i> 
and <i>the Abhidharmakosasastra</i>, etc. also have this sort of problems. This 
strongly suggests that it is extremely difficult to collate the Buddhist texts, 
and also shows clearly that it is highly necessary for us to <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「recollate」，按前後文義修訂作「re-collate」。">
re-collate</span> the said texts.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">A group under 
this column is properly formed by three texts, the <i>YinYuan Xin Lun Song</i>, 
the <i>Yin Yuan Xin Lun Shi</i>, and the <i>Yin Yuan Xin Lun Shi Kai Jue Ji</i>, 
of which the first two were originally written by Nagarjuna, a celebrated Indian 
Buddhist theoretician and the initiator of the doctrine of the Madhyamika. The 
theory of the pratityasamutpada is the fundamental theory of the early Buddhism 
founded by Sakyamuni. By expounding mutual promotion and extermination between 
the twelve causes 
(dvadasangapratityasamutpada), it shows that all things on the 
earth emerge, exist, and get extinct under certain conditions, thus having 
proved the unreliability of the samskrtadharma and the truthfulness of the 
nirvanadharma. In Sakyamuni's theoretical system, the theory of the 
pratityasamutpada was a kind of explanation of the mode of existence of all 
things on the earth, and he did not deny the existence of these very things. 
Nevertheless, according to Nagarjuna, only conditions are the most fundamental 
and all things derived now that they exist and change under certain conditions, 
thus leading to the pratityasamutpadasvabhavasunya, which is a fundamental 
theory of the Madhyamika. And the <i>Yin Yuan Xin Lun Song</i> and the <i>Yin 
Yuan Xin Lun Shi</i> are Nagarjuna's two important works to transform the theory 
of the pratityasamutpada of the early Buddhism into that of the 
pratityasamutpadasyabhavasunya, and rank exceptionally among the whole works by 
Nagarjuna and in the theory of the Madhyamika. Unfortunately, these two very 
important works had remained unknown to the people of the Central Plains in 
China and, accordingly, had not been included into the traditional Chinese 
Dazangjing since their being translated into Chinese in northwest China in the 
8th century or so. When they were discovered among the surviving books from
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「Dnhuang」，按前後文義修訂作「Dunhuang」。">Dunhuang</span> 
in the 20th century, people regarded them as invaluable treasures and promptly 
collected them into the 32nd volume of the <i>Dazhengzang</i>. Owing to the 
limited conditions then, the texts included into the <i>Dazhengzang</i> 
were collated in the light of only two versions of the texts preserved in 
England as the surviving books from Dunhuang, and hence some errors and 
omissions. The <i>Yin YuanXin Lun Song</i> and the <i>Yin Yuan Xin Lun Shi</i> 
published in this number have been collated respectively according to seven and 
eight versions of the texts among the surviving books from Dunhuang. Therefore, 
I should say that the newly collated texts are of better quality. The <i>Yin 
Yuan Xin Lun Shi Kai Jue Ji</i> should have been written by a certain monk in 
Dunhuang, probably an eminent one running a free school under the domination of 
the ancient Tibet. It is regrettable that we now have no material from which we 
can find out his name. It deals with Nagarjuna's two originals properly and 
elucidates the theory of the Madhyamika clearly. If we read the three texts 
comparatively, we can reach profounder understanding of the Indian Buddhist 
ideology of the Madhyamika. The <i>Kai Jue Ji</i> was included into the 85th 
volume of the Dazangjing, but the master copy of the text kept in England was 
fragmentary at the end; and it was the only version and had no collated text 
with it. The text published here in this number has been collated according to 
four versions among the surviving books from Dunhuang and has essentially 
restored the true features of the initial Chinese text. I am assured that the 
publication of the three <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「recollated」，按前後文義修訂作「re-collated」。">
re-collated</span> texts will be
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「benifitial」，按前後文義修訂作「beneficial」。">
beneficial</span> to those who make studies of Nagarjuna and the ideology of the 
Madhyamika.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The <i>
Jingangjing</i>

(Vajracchedikaprajnaparamitasutra) is a very important Buddhist 
work, which has been translated into Chinese for six times in China since 
antiquity. The most popular translation of the text has been that produced by 
Kumarajiva; therefore, most of the currently circular commentaries on the <i>
Jingangjing</i> 
just annotate the translation by him. In the surviving books from Dunhuang, 
Kumarajiva's translation and the related commentaries form the bulk of all the 
extant <i>Jingangjing</i> and its commentaries. The <i>Jingangjing Shu</i> 
published in this number, however, is a commentary on the translation by 
Bodhiruci in the Northern Wei Dynasty 
(386-534 AD), so it is more precious. Moreover, the explanatory 
notes of this text on the <i>Jingangjing</i> are precise, appropriate, brief, 
and to the point, so it has been regarded as one of the highly rated 
commentaries on the scripture. Nevertheless, this commentary has never been 
recorded in any catalog of the Buddhist Cannon through the ages, and has never 
been collected into any of the Dazangjing of the past dynasties. Fortunately, it 
was <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「discoverd」，按前後文義修訂作「discovered」。">
discovered</span> in the Beijing Library a few years ago. It consists of three 
parts and are labeled from No.1 to No.3. After careful identification, we find 
out that the three numbers of the text share the same stylistic rules and layout 
and the same wording, and their content is successive from one to the another. 
We come to the conclusion that they. are torn parts of the same text. Besides, 
the pages of the transcript once fell off. The later mender was careless; 
therefore, the extant transcript was out of order. We have restored its proper 
order in the newly collated text. After we put the three numbers together, the 
surviving content of the commentary is equal to that from the 14th to the 32th 
fen (section) in the version of the <i>
Jingangjing</i> by Gumarajiva; this means that it is still fragmentary as far as 
the beginning part is concerned. But what is exciting is that the beginning part 
of the text has been discovered recently among the surviving books from Dunhuang 
preserved in England by Mr. ZHAO Ruihe, who is now participating in cataloging 
the surviving books from Dunhuang in the Beijing Library. Thus, although this 
text has not yet become perfect, it is almost complete at last. What is 
regrettable is that parts of some pages have been missing, so the meaning of the 
text is disconnected at intervals. Even the text kept in England can not closely 
match and mend the text kept in the
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「Bejing」，按前後文義修訂作「Beijing」。">Beijing</span> 
Library. It is just like the
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「brokenarmed」，按前後文義修訂作「broken armed」。">
broken armed</span> Venus de Milo; while impressing one with unique sensuous 
beauty, it makes him deeply regretful. However, as it is the natural law for the 
moon to wax and wane, nothing in this world can be so perfect that it leaves no 
regrets.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">During the reign 
of the ancient Tibet, there emerged in Dunhuang a Buddhist bhadanta named 
Facheng, who was well versed in both Chinese and Tibetan and translated a great 
number of scriptures into the two languages. As an eminent monk running a free 
school, he lectured on sutras and sastras and taught doctrines to his disciples 
during breaks in translation. Now the collections of the surviving books from 
Dunhuang contain a lot of notebooks used by the disciples while attending his 
lectures. The <i>Yu Jia Lun Juan Di Si Shou Ji</i>, published in this number, is 
one of the notebooks. This kind of notebooks, also named <i>Sui Ting Ji</i> or <i>
Sui Ting Shu</i>, contain notes made by the disciples when they were attending 
the lectures on the
<i>Yogacarabhumisastra</i> 
given by Facheng. Many a such notebook is kept in the surviving books from 
Dun-huang. The 85th volume of the <i>Dazhengzang</i> contains only a small 
portion of them. A number of years ago, Mr. Daishun UEYAMA, the Japanese scholar 
we mentioned above, after having made a relatively exhaustive search of these 
notebooks, reorganized them and listed them in a table, which is available in 
his book entitled <i>A Study of Buddhism in Dunhuang</i>. Since then, a number 
of new material has been discovered. We plan to try our best to sort out the 
relevant
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「literture」，按前後文義修訂作「literature」。">
literature</span>, because both Facheng himself and his thinking are of 
considerable significance to the studies of both local Buddhism in Dunhuang and 
SinoTibetan Buddhist exchanges, and the related texts have never been included 
into any of the Dazangjing of the past dynasties in China yet. However, the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「noteboks」，按前後文義修訂作「notebooks」。">
notebooks</span> are really too many, and the handwriting is generally rather 
informal and illegible, making collation a very troublesome job. As a result, we 
can only offer these would-be texts to our readers step by step in accordance 
with the space available in our <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i> 
as well as the progress of our collation.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">One text is 
published in the section &quot;Doubtful and Spurious Works&quot;.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">According to 
Buddhist tradition, Buddha had both 32 obvious <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「physcal」，按前後文義修訂作「physical」。">
physical</span> features
(dvatrimsamahapurusalaksana) 
and 80 subtle physical points 
(asityanuvyanjanani) 
of a great man. Both the miraculous physical features and the excellent physical 
points are objects for monks to watch and speculate while sitting in meditation. 
Many scriptures have discussed the details of these physical features and 
points. The <i>Xiang Hao Jing</i> published in this number is composed of 
relevant passages taken from both the <i>Guan Xiang Pin</i> and the <i>Ben Xing 
Pin</i> 
of the <i>Guan Fo San Mei Hai Jing</i>. According to Chinese Buddhist tradition, 
these scriptures should be regarded as spurious ones. Owing to their status, 
most of them have lacked necessary collation, so there have appeared all kinds 
of variant versions during the period of their circulation. So are the <i>Tian 
Gong Jing</i> 
and the <i>Fo Mu Jing</i> published in the first number and the <i>Xiang Hao 
Jing</i> 
published in this number, the case of the latter being more complicated. 
According to the information available, the <i>Xiang Had Jing</i> has five 
different versions, which can be divided into two major <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「systyms」，按前後文義修訂作「systems」。">
systems</span>. Except a small number of minor doubtful and spurious works such 
as the <i>Xin Pu Sa Jing</i>, the case like this was really rare in ancient 
China. Therefore, we may discuss whether these different versions should be 
collated into one text or should be collated and kept as separate variant 
versions. The <i>Xiang Hao Jing</i> <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「publisged」，按前後文義修訂作「published」。">
published</span> here is to provide the readers with some basic material for 
reference in this area.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">One paper is 
brought forth in the section &quot;Research Papers&quot;.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">In 1930's, a 
monk named Fan Cheng discovered the <i>Jinzang</i> in the Guangsheng Temple in 
Zhaocheng County, Shanxi Province, and Jiang Weixin published his <i>Jinzang 
Diaoyin Shimo Kao
(A History of the Jinzang)</i> 
- The <i>Jinzang</i> has gained increasing reputation ever since. Nevertheless, 
people are not very clear all the time about the process of the engraving, 
printing, and circulation of the <i>Jinzang</i> 
because of lacking material. Jiang Weixin put forth a hypothesis that the 
engraved blocks for printing the <i>Jinzang</i> had been transported to the 
capital
(then named Yanjing) 
and were stored in the Hongfa Temple; people later engraved some more blocks and 
produced the <i>Hongfazang</i>. This has remained an unsolved mystery, though 
many scholars in the academic circles have accepted the hypothesis. The <i>
Jinzang Xin Ziliao Kao
( A Study of the New Material 
Concerning the Jinzang )</i> 
published in this number is the result of a serious study of two notes on the <i>
Jinzang</i> 
found in the <i>Qishazang</i>, which was produced successively in the Ming 
Dynasty
(1368 @ 1644) 
and is now preserved in the Beijing Library. I trust that this paper will be 
very useful for clarifying various statements on the <i>Jinzang</i>.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Finally a few 
words about the size and form of the Chinese characters used in our book.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">No.5 block 
characters were used for most of the texts published in the first two <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「nembers」，按前後文義修訂作「numbers」。">
numbers</span> 
of the <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>. If comments and 
notes appeared in the same text. No.5 Song typeface characters were used for 
printing. Our purpose was to publish more texts within limited space by using 
smaller sized characters. However, after reading the first two books, many 
readers have pointed out that the character size is too small and inconvenient 
especially to senior readers. Therefore, beginning from this number, we shall 
use No.4
(small) block 
characters for texts proper and No.4
(small) Song 
typeface characters for comments and notes. We shall continue to apply No.5 Song 
typeface characters
(for the purpose of book 
printing) 
to explanatory notes on titles and research papers. Each forthcoming number of 
the <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i> will still contain 300 
thousand characters or so after we have enlarged the size of the characters used 
in most part of the book.</p>
