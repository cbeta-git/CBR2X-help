<p class="head">Foreword</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The foreword to each volume of <i>Buddhist 
Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i> acts as a bridge between the editors and 
the readers and introduces the readers to the main contents of the respective 
volume.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Let us first of all talk about 
what it means by <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The &quot;Collection&quot; means the Great 
Collection of the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「Sprictures」，按前後文義修訂作「Scriptures」。">Scriptures</span> of Buddhism
(Fojiao Dazangjing, Tripitaka). What traditionally is 
called &quot;Dazangjing&quot; means specifically the Chinese Tripitaka, including the Main 
Collection (Zheng Zang) and the Supplementary 
Collection (Xu Zang). It constitutes the comprehensive 
compilation of Buddhist texts in Chinese. Although there are many kinds of 
Chinese Tripitaka in our country, there still are many texts which have 
something to do with Buddhism. They are found elsewhere and are outside the 
Tripitaka. Here we find, for example: all kinds of Buddhist scriptures 
translated in modern times from Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.; a 
great amount of Buddhist texts from the Dunhuang Scripture Cave; ancient 
Buddhist texts which are kept in various libraries and museums and have not yet 
been included in the Tripitakas of the various eras; Buddhist materials 
preserved in dynastic histories, local <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「gazeteers」，按前後文義修訂作「gazetteers」。">gazetteers</span>
classified reference books and collected works of individual persons; materials 
on stone and bronze inscriptions; Buddhist works and materials of recent dates. 
All the above-mentioned works can be called <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the 
Tripitaka</i>. Literature is one of the main carriers of culture, and Buddhist 
literature is one of the main carriers of Buddhist culture. The texts already 
contained in the collections are, of course, very important; however, also the 
literary contributions not yet contained in the Tripitaka should not be 
overlooked, but must be carefully edited. What has to be stated clearly is, that 
after the often repeated critical work applied to them, the quality of the texts 
in the Main Collection of the various eras is generally rather high; on the 
contrary, works included in the Supplementary Collection are often of a rather 
arbitrary nature, they lack a careful selection and text critical work, and 
often they have wrong characters. Therefore, although some texts have already 
been included in some supplementary collections, if the quality of newly 
discovered texts is higher than that of texts already contained in the Tripitaka, 
this should also be an objective of our editorial work.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">There are now three main current 
versions of the Buddhist Canon: the Pali Canon of the southern tradition, the 
Chinese version of the Tripitaka, and the Tibetan Kanjur and Tanjur. Some 
Sanskrit Buddhist texts are extant, and recently there are constant new 
discoveries of Sanskrit texts, but they are in general mutilated leaves of 
particular units. Although their value for research cannot be underestimated, 
they do not amount to a complete Tripitaka. Furthermore, in China there still 
are complete Tripitakas in the Dai language, in Mongolian, in Manchu, and many 
incomplete parts of the Tripitaka in the Tangut language which have been 
unearthed. However, the above-mentioned Buddhist collections are basically all 
derived and translated from the before-mentioned three main versions of the 
Buddhist collections. The meaning and value for Buddhist research of the Pali 
Tripitaka, the Chinese versions of the Tripitaka and the Tibetan Kanjur and 
Tanjur are therefore self-evident.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Talking only about the 
above-mentioned three main collections of the Buddhist scriptures, the Chinese 
Tripitaka <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「containes」，按前後文義修訂作「contained」。">contained</span> the greatest number of scriptures, 
the extent of time to which the texts belong is the longest, the territory they 
cover is the vastest, the Buddhist schools they represent are the most. 
Therefore, although the Pali Canon and the Tibetan Buddhist Canon retain their 
irreplaceable and unique value for research, the Chinese version of the 
Tripitaka evidently deserves men's even more attention.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">In modern times, developing their 
Buddhist research, Buddhist scholars in the West generally focus their attention 
on a sequence of Pali Canon — Sanskrit Buddhist texts — Tibetan Buddhist texts. 
Scholars devoted to research of Chinese Buddhist texts are relatively few. Such 
a situation, compared with the value of the Chinese Buddhist texts themselves, 
is rather unbalanced. The reason for such a state, apart from many other causes, 
might be the obstacle of the language and lack of understanding for the Chinese 
Tripitaka and of its value. Now many scholars have begun to pay attention to 
this problem, and there are many Chinese and foreign scholars who call for and 
devote themselves to the translation of Chinese Buddhist texts into English. I 
am deeply convinced that many more people will come to an ever deeper 
understanding of the value of the Chinese Buddhist texts and develop penetrating 
research into them. And the Chinese Tripitaka will in this process offer its due 
contribution to the reconstruction and development of mankind's culture.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">If we endeavour to collect and 
edit, as far as possible, the literary contributions of Buddhism which still are 
lying scattered outside the collection of Buddhist scriptures, and if we add 
them to the collection, the Chinese Tripitaka will in future offer an even much 
greater contribution to the development and research of Buddhism and to the 
culture of mankind.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">This, then, is the goal of 
<i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>. Let us editors and all who are 
concerned with this matter encourage each other in our endeavours.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Next let me introduce the main 
contents of the first number of <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The column &quot;Chan Texts from 
Dunhuang&quot; of the first number brings four newly discovered Chan texts from 
Dunhuang: <i>Tianzhuguo Putidamo Chanshi Lun, Chance Wenda</i>, and <i>Xizheng Lun</i> are 
copied in sequence on one roll of Dunhuang writings. The <i>Chance Wenda</i> explains 
through thirty questions and answers many concrete questions of Chan practice; <i>Xizheng 
Lun</i> explains emphatically that the true Buddhata is within the mind, and 
therefore cannot be understood as taking recourse to what is external to it; it 
is opposed to a style of study which only knows how to seek great knowledge of 
and critical inquisition into truth. These texts have all been discovered quite 
recently and are being published for the first time. I think that they are all 
works of the Northern Chan School, most probably in the line of Yi Fu. Through 
them the reader can advance in his understanding of the Northern Chan School. 
Under the name of Dharma, the first patriarch of the Chan School, the <i>Tianzhuguo 
Putidamo Chanshi Lun</i> discusses the method of the Chan School. What is published 
here is a newly discovered manuscript; compared with another book of the same 
name in Pelliot's special collection of Dunhuang preserved in France, its ending 
has another paragraph and gives us some more new information.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The column &quot;Esoteric Texts&quot; of the 
first number brings a text from the Indian Esoteric Buddhism, the <i>Ba Zhong Cu 
Zhong Fan Duo</i>. The author of this text is unknown, it is, however, ascribed to 
Ashvagosha. It discusses eight points of the Vinaya of Esoteric Buddhism. The 
text belongs to the ones discovered in the old sites (Heicheng) 
of Xixia and has its value for the study of Tangut Buddhism.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The section &quot;Commentaries on the 
Tripitaka&quot; brings a text each from commentaries to the sutras and the vinayas:</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>Tian Qing Wen Jing Shu</i> is a work 
by the famous Tang monk Wengui. The Taisho Daizokyo has included a mutilated 
copy of this commentary. Here we publish a complete and corrected copy.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>Xing Shi Chao Zhong Fen Men Tu 
Lu</i> is an outline for the <i>Si Fen Lu Xing Shi Chao</i> of the Tang monk Shi Daoxuan. 
The original book had used graphical representations, which explains the name. 
Their publication being hampered by given conditions, it is changed to the form 
of an outline.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Anhui, the author of <i>A Pi Da Mo 
Ju She Lun Shi Yi Shu</i>, is one of the famous &quot;ten great shastra masters&quot; of 
Indian Buddhism. In the main it is a refutation of the criticism of Samghabhadra 
in his <i>Shun Zheng Li Lun</i> against Vasubandhu's <i>Abhidharma Kosa Sastra</i> and 
reflects a main work of Indian Buddhism of the second half of the 6th century. 
There is no mention in the sutra catalogues of our country on the time when this 
work was written or who translated it into Chinese. Taisho Daizokyo has included 
a partial copy based upon Pelliot's special collection. What we publish here is 
the complete third volume of the said commentary. The present manuscript had 
wandered around among people for a while since its discovery in Dunhuang is 
finally kept in the Beijing Library. When lately we checked another bunch of 
book fragments from Dunhuang at the Beijing Library, we discovered the first 
missing part of this book, which enabled us to reconstruct the original, a 
really lucky event. Among the extant Dunhuang books there is a Uighur version of 
this <i>Shi Yi Shu</i>, so that the two can be compared.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">In the section &quot;Doubtful and 
Spurious Works&quot; of the first number are published eight doubtful and spurious 
works from Dunhuang. Most of these doubtful and spurious works are published for 
the first time. Although some had been published earlier by somebody, this time 
they all have been critically revised according to the various kinds of 
manuscripts, wrong characters have been emended or lacking parts added. We must 
say that &quot;Doubtful and Spurious Sutras&quot; is a very complicated concept. Many 
among them are no products of Chinese as one might imagine. This question later 
on has to become the subject of a special debate.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>Fo Wei Xin Wang Pu Sa Shuo Tou 
Tuo Jing</i> is a work which has had great influence on the Chan School. At the 
moment there is no information on its author or the time of its composition. 
Earlier we knew already that there were two mutilated Chinese and one mutilated 
Sogdian copy, and that the contents of the manuscripts in the two languages did 
not correspond to each other. The publication in the present number is a 
complete Chinese version which allows the Sogdian version to have a reliable 
work for comparison. The Chinese copy has notes and commentary added. It can be 
expected that the publication of the present text will be of great use not only 
for the study of the Chan School, but also for study of Soghdian.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>Fo Shuo Xiao Shun Zi Xiu Xing 
Cheng Fo Jing</i> and <i>Zui Miao Sheng Ding Jing</i> are classified as doubtful and 
spurious sutras by the traditional sutra catalogues. But from the texts 
published in the present number people will see that they all have been brought 
into China from outside and have not been written by Chinese. <i>Shui Yue Guan Yin 
Jing</i> reflects the worship of Guanyin in Chinese Buddhism; <i>Jing Gang Jing Zuan</i> 
reflects the worship of sutras in Chinese Buddhism; the <i>Da Fang Guang Hua Yan 
Shi E Pin Jing</i> is a product of the vegetarian movement of Chinese Buddhism 
during the time of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Since doubtful and 
spurious works have mostly circulated among the people and there was no 
authoritative editing, it was easy for various different versions to appear. The 
<i>Tian Gong Jing</i> which we publish here has three different versions, the <i>Fo Mu 
Jing</i> has four different versions, which reflects the situation in this regard.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The section &quot;Research Papers&quot; 
brings one articles:</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The article &quot;Some Problems 
Concerning the <i>Chan Zang</i> and the Chan Writings from Dunhuang&quot; assumes that the 
<i>Chan Zang</i> has effectively been composed by the Tang monk Zongmi. After an 
inquisition into the <i>Chan Zang</i> and an analysis of the present condition of the 
Dunhuang Chan writings the article points out that considerable part of Zongmi's 
<i>Chan Zang</i> has been preserved in the Chan writings of Dunhuang and that it is 
possible to reconstruct the Chan Zang according to the Chan Writings of Dunhuang. 
This will certainly open a new chapter in our research into Chan Buddhism.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Finally some desiderata. <i>Buddhist 
Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i> is a tender sprout which has just sprung 
up and urgently hopes to find such support as follows:</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">We earnestly hope that the readers 
will voice honest criticism concerning our editorial work, including the 
definition of chapter headings, the choice of the master copies, discussion of 
characters, notes on textual criticism, segmentation and punctuation, 
explanatory notes on the background of the works, and other questions. In this 
way the work of Buddhist texts not included in the Tripitaka will be done in an 
even better way.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Buddhist works not included in the 
Tripitaka are scattered everywhere, and it is extremely difficult to collect 
them. We earnestly hope that people everywhere will come up with information and 
material on Buddhist texts which are not yet included in the Tripitaka; we will 
be deeply grateful even for just a <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「schort」，按前後文義修訂作「short」。">short</span> note. Anyone 
who contributes a master copy to be used will be mentioned by name and receive 
our deepest thanks. The sincerest thanks will go to anybody who will submit an 
article for publication. For details see <i>Guidelines on Submitting Articles</i>.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>Buddhist Texts Not Included in 
the Tripitaka</i> has no financial resources of its own. We are very grateful to 
the Institute of Chinese Buddhist Culture and the Zhi Lian Jing Yuan from Hong 
Kong for their kind support to the publication of this very first book. We hope 
that all men of insight could generously fund the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「pubilication」，按前後文義修訂作「publication」。">publication</span> 
of the next number of the same book.</p>
