<p class="head">FOREWORD</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
It has been more than one year and half past since the last three
books come to the light at the same time in Sept., 1998. Now
when the editor is preparing to write a few words to our readers
for the publication of Book Ⅶ, he find a great many
complicated feelings emerged in his heart.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
There is an old saying in Buddhism that life is filled of eight
sufferings, i.e. suffering from birth, old age, sickness, death,
parting of lovers, meeting of foes, failing to acquire, and the
last category of all grief, sorrow, despair and lamentation.
During the past period of more than 20 months, the editor has
experienced all kinds of emotions, though I cannot put them all
into the category of life's sufferings.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
The sage Lao Zi in antique China once said: &quot;What I suffer for
is only resulted from the existence of my body. If without this
body, whatever suffering will come upon me? &quot; Nonetheless,
life is always going on, and people always have their own duty
to do. In my case, the editing work of <i><strong>the Buddhist Texts Not
Contained In the Tripit&#257;ka</strong></i> has to proceed as usual. Sometimes
I would suddenly be taken by a thought that life's motivation is
some duty or mission that pushes us to overcome all difficulties
in the world. It is the duty or mission that leads us to go on
with the publication of <i><strong>the Buddhist Texts Not Contained In
the Tripit&#257;ka. </strong></i></p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
The Book Ⅶ contains scriptures as follows:</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
In the column of &quot;Commentaries on the Tripit&#257;ka&quot; we select a
text titled as <strong>Zu xin yao fa men</strong> (the Commentary to the Heart
Elements Behind Dharma Door) by Zong Mi who was an
eminent monk of the Huayan(Avatamsaka) School. The
original one (the <strong>Xin yao fa men</strong>) was written by Master
Cheng Guan who inherited the line of the Huayan. The text is
short, but with the far reaching significance, as it summarized
the essential doctrine of the Huayan School.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
The <strong>Xin yao fa men</strong> was once included in the <strong>Jing de chuan
deng lu</strong> (Jing de Record of the Chan light Passing on) in 30
volumes and was not able to circulate in a separate form. Zong
Mi did a huge number of writing work on Buddhist scripture
and he made a great contribution to the Huayan and Chan
Schools. As a monk scholar, his making a commentary to the
<strong>Xin yao fa men</strong> does not surprise our imagination. Yet the text
cannot be found in any catalogs of Buddhist Canon as well as
in any versions of the Tripit&#257;ka for all times. <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「Irt」，按前後文義修訂作「It」。">It</span> was probable
that the text is too short to draw any attention from Buddhist
scholars. Even when the list of Zong Mi's works, which was
called <strong>&quot;Da chen Chan men Yao lu&quot;</strong> <i>(the Key Catalog of
Mahayana Chan Buddhism)</i> among the surviving manuscripts
from the Dunhuang Buddhist Cave, was compiled, the <strong>Zu xin
yao fa men</strong> was still ignored.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
Yet this never means that the <strong>Zu xin yao fa men</strong> is not
important to students who want to study the Huayan School
and Master Zong Mi's ideology. To judge objectively, Behind
the fluent and succinct wording of the text, one can usually
obtain much information of importance wherein.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
The text was originally discovered in the town of Hei Chen that
was one of relic sites of the ancient Xixia dynasty. And the
original scroll is kept in the Petersburg, Russia. When the
editor stayed in Japan as a visiting scholar in 1994, the late
scholar Iriya Yoshitaka (入矢義高) presented a duplicate to
him. So the publication of the collated text is also in memory
of Mr. Iriya Yoshitaka who passed away in 1998.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
From Book Ⅶ on, a new column titled &quot;Buddhist Rituals and
Rites&quot; has been added to <i><strong>the Buddhist Texts Not Contained In
the Tripit&#257;ka. </strong></i> As we know, the traditional study focused its
attention upon the materials concerning Buddhist ideology and
history. And the materials reflecting the actual religious
activities in old society were generally neglected. In this
direction, the editor has gained deep feelings through many
years of researching experience that the faithful and devotional
practice in Buddhism is an indispensable part of a living
religion. The role of folk Buddhism should be much more
important than people could have imagined before in study of a
religious civilization. Therefore, we will later devote much
more attention and energy to collate the materials of this kind,
and provide some basic data to researchers at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
The <strong>Jin gang wu li</strong> (<i>the five salutes to Vajras&#363;tra</i>) 
contained
in this book comes from the scroll from the Dunhuang
Buddhist Cave. As everyone knows, the <strong>Jin gang jing</strong> (<i>the
Vajraacchedika prajnaparamita s&#363;tra</i>) is representative of the
rational trend in Buddhism, and repenting and worshiping
action in Buddhist ceremony is another trend characteristic of
faithful exercises and customs. In this sense, the <strong>Jin gang Wu
li</strong> embodies the unification of the two trends in Buddhism.
According to the collator Mr.Da Zao, the melting point is the
conception of <strong>Xia ye</strong> (karma erasing) in the text, which is a
view worthy of our consideration. In addition, the conception
of the San sheng yi fo (three bodies and one buddha) is also
quite different from the traditional idea of San sheng fo (the
Buddha in Tri Bodies). From scrutinizing the text, we can learn
that in ancient times there at least existed such a way of
copying scripture, i.e. in the process one person read the text to
be copied, and the another one wrote down as he heard.
Therefore, there would occur a lot of errors to use homonyms
in text dictation. And those errors offer to us a precious chance
to study phonology in the ancient Dunhuang area ,and even a
referring determinant to find the law of homonym error
happened in copying Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
Another text concerning religious rituals in Buddhist services is
the <strong>Jin gang li</strong> (Vajra prajnaparamita s&#363;tra Salutation) from 
<strong>the
Fangshan Stone Scripture.</strong> It was written by Monk Heng Ce,
Master Tongli, living in the Liao Dynasty (983 1066). One of
the features in this text is to match the San bao (Three Treasures)
with the 32 components consisting of the
<strong>Vajracchedikaprajna s&#363;tra.</strong> And in the service process each
component should be worshiped respectively one by one. This
practice remind us of the Gong de ping (the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「catagory」，按前後文義修訂作「category」。">category</span> of merits)
in <i><strong>the Da zang jing zhong mu </strong></i>(<i>the General Catalog of the
Tripitaka</i>). The so called Gong de ping exemplifies the
worshiping act of scriptures typical of devotional Buddhism.
This text is written in a way called Leng yan wan, which is a
particular writing form especially serving the kind of Buddhist
rituals. This book is unable to offer a photo showing the form
of the Leng yan wan, but our readers are supposed to take a
reference to such <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「exemples」，按前後文義修訂作「examples」。">examples</span> in the facsimile of <strong>the Fangshan
Stone Scripture.</strong></p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
In the Book Ⅵ, we published some materials about Ali
Cultism of Yunnan Province, which aroused much interests
among students. Judging by the data, we know that a religion
spread in differential forms at various levels in a society. In the
past, we were usually familiar with the Buddhist institution
prevailing at the upper society, and now we are ushered by the
materials into a new realm of Ali Cultism. In front of our
readers' eyes, there are two texts concerning the Ali in this
book. One is the <strong>Hu guo si nang chao</strong> which is the earliest
manuscript as people know, but it is not accessible to readers
until now when we publish it by the book. Another text called
<strong>&quot;Fo shuo xiao zai yan shou yao shi guan ding zhang ju
yi&quot;</strong>(<i>the sentence rituals in the Bhaisajyaguru abhiseka services
to dispel disasters and prolong life</i>). It is obvious that the
rituals are worked out basing the scripture of the Bhaisajyaguru
purvapranidhana s&#363;tra that enjoyed overpowering enthusiasm
among the folk mass in the ancient China. And the text gives
us some hint to understand both folk worshiping activities
described in the surviving manuscripts from the Dunhuang
Buddhist cave as well as the function of the Bhaisajyaguru
purvapranidhana s&#363;tra in the folk devotionalism.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
As in the column of &quot;Dubitable and Forged Scriptures&quot;, there
are two texts published. The first is the <strong>Jing du san mei jing</strong>
(<i>the purely delivering Samadhi s&#363;tra</i>) in 3 volumes. The
scripture appeared in the period of the North and South
Dynasty and cited by lots of later Buddhist works. The
scripture was put into the class of dubitable and forged
scriptures early in the Tang period, as Monk Zhi Sheng did
when he sorted out Buddhist Canon and compiled the <strong>Kai
yuan shi jiao lu</strong> (<i>the Kai yuan Catalog of Buddhist Scriptures</i>),
since he found some precedents had criticized the <strong>Jing du san
mei jing</strong> for its disparity from the orthodox teachings. Besides,
there were quite a few differed translations of the text as well
as an abridged version prevalent before. Following Monk Zhi
Sheng, all the later tripitakas refused taking in the <strong>Jing du san
mei jing.</strong></p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
So after the Tang, almost nobody mentioned the text until the
20th century when the <strong>Xu zng jin</strong> (<i>the Japanese Continued
Buddhist Canon</i>) was compiled and a manuscript was
discovered in an old temple. But there was only one volume
survived for the scripture. As the surviving manuscripts at the
Dunhuang Buddhist caves were unearthed, researchers have
found at least 12 incomplete volumes of the <strong>Jing du san mei
jing</strong> which is kept separately in museums in London, Paris and
Tokyo. All those manuscripts were not enough to restore the
complete feature of the text. Fortunately, in the middle of
1990s the 2nd and 3rd volumes of the text were discovered by
Professor Ochiai Toshinori (落合俊典) in the Shichi Temple at
Nagoya, Japan. The volumes were dated as copied in the Heian
period (12th century). Up to now students had been able to
restore the whole scripture. The precious literature with a photo,
and the researching results were all published in the appendix
of Book Ⅱ of the Studying Series Concerning Old Unknown
Texts Stored in the Shichi Temple (Taito Press, 1996/2). What
our readers see about the text in this book was presented by Mr.
Ouchi Fumio (大內文雄) and Mr. Saito Takanobu (齊藤隆信),
who are both collators. They had re edited the text according to
our requirements before offering it to <i><strong>the Buddhist Texts Not
Contained In the Tripit&#257;ka.</strong></i></p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
Here the previous problem occurs again as the scripture is re
exposed to the light. Can we still persist it is only a forged one?
What position it should hold properly in the translating history
of Buddhist scriptures? According to the both Japanese
scholars, the text belongs to the category of the dubitable and
forged. Their opinion can be checked in the title explanation
and their letter that appended to this book. By contrary, I
preserve my own view regarding the matter. In an article sent
to <i>the Studying Series Concerning Old Unknown Texts Stored
in the Shichi Temple</i>, I made a textual research and testified the
credibility of the text. And another Chinese scholar Mr.Yao
Chang shou regarded the text reflecting conceptions what
Master Zong Mi called &quot;Ren tian jiao (Teachings for Man and
Deva /Hinayana Doctrine)&quot;. The editor believes there is much
more room to further exploration and hopes hope that the
scripture's publication in this book will arouse more interests
and discussions.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
Another text of the same kind is the <strong>Di zang pu sha shi zai ri</strong>
(<i>the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Ten Fasting Days</i>). This is a very
small in length among the surviving manuscripts from the
Dunhuang Buddhist Cave. As a writing version, it actually
does not belong to any part of the three categories as s&#363;tra,
vinaya and dharma. Its function is only to serve a fasting ritual
in Buddhist ceremonies. The text tells that on each day of the
10 in a month, a particular deva (heaven god) comes from the
high down to the earth to supervise the mortal. And the people
living on the earth should meditate the god by continuously
calling his title in order to be favored. Otherwise, people would
be caught by disasters or even go to the hell after life.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
It is worthy of stressing the fact that there is a great number of
the scripture of the same kind. In addition to these written
copies, there also exist the rubbing copies from the version of
stone carved scriptures found at County Dazhu, Sichuan. Thus
we have mastered 6 forms of the text that demonstrate the
changing development of the rituals as the Ksitigarbha
Bodhisattva Fasting Days' services transmitted in China. By
this collated version, we are able to find the changing track of
transmitting Buddhist texts. In this connection, study of
scriptures can be instructive.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
The Xixia r&eacute;gime which was confronting with the North Song
and Liao r&eacute;gimes, was built by the Dangxiang people. The
latter held high reverence to Buddhism. The prosperous
Buddhism in the Xixia society left abundant literature to later
peoples. Since the 20th century we have acquired an increasing
knowledge about the Xixia culture as more and more Buddhist
archaeological materials excavated in the present Ningxia
region where was the territory of the former Xixia r&eacute;gime. A
few years ago, I was invited to the Ningxia region to take part
in the sorting out work of a bunch of Buddhist scriptures in
Chinese, which survived a serious sacking act by outlaws to a
square pagoda dated to the Xixia period (11 13th c.). Here we
list the group of texts as follows:</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
<strong>The Yuan jue dao chang li chan</strong> (<i>the Worshiping and
Repenting for the Perfect Enlightenment Grand Service</i>) which
can be referred to the variety of Buddhist services prevalent in
the region of Han people.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
<strong>The Yi ben hiu zhu zhong sheng yi qie ku nan jing</strong> (<i>the
Varied Version of Delivering All Living Things From Sufferings</i>)
which can be referred to the surviving materials from the
Dunhuang Buddhist Caves such as the <strong>Fo tu cheng suo hua
jing</strong> (<i>the S&#363;tra of Master Fo tu cheng's Teachings</i>), the <strong>Da 
ci
ru lai gao su,the Jiu zhu yi qie zhong sheng ku nang
jing</strong> (<i>the S&#363;tra of Delivering All Living Things From 
Sufferings</i>),
the <strong>Xin pu sa jing</strong> (<i>the S&#363;tra of New Bodhisattvas</i>), and 
the
<strong>Quan Shan jing</strong> (<i>the S&#363;tra Persuading to Do Good</i>), etc. 
More
than ten years ago, the editor had such a suspicion that the text
like the <strong>Xin pu sa jing</strong> was the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「heritagy」，按前後文義修訂作「heritage」。">heritage</span> of a peasant 
uprising.
Now it seems not able to hold the ground. All of these posters
and like remained throughout in the history until the modern
time. What message does this phenomenon suggest to us? Is
there any nationality contained for the Chinese people?

Out of the survivals, one dubitable text is the <strong>Fo ding xing to
luo ni jing</strong> (<i>the Buddhoshnrsha hrdaya dharani s&#363;tra</i>) which
was also excavated in the Ningxia region. In spite of its
incompleteness, the whole text can be restored by reference to
another two versions in the <i><strong>Fangshan Stone Scriptures.</strong></i> In
order to show the text's original feature as unearthed in this
book, we tried to reproduce the layout when typeset.

As we have known, Indian Buddhism was fiercely attacked by
Confucians as being against the filial piety when it was first
introduced into China. And that's why the late Buddhists put
their stress on the moral relation all the time, and defend
themselves against non Buddhists' criticism. The <strong>Ru lai guang
xiao shi zhong bao en dao chang yi</strong> (<i>the Tath&#257;gata's Rituals
for the Ten Grand services to Recompense Gratitude</i>), which
will come out in our next book(Book Ⅷ), means to prove that
the incomparable filial piety can be practiced only following
the Buddha's way. And the <strong>Fo ding xing to luo ni jing</strong> here
coveys the same import in a similar way.

Finally, the editor want to call readers' <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「attetion」，按前後文義修訂作「attention」。">attention</span> to the binding
form and <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「playout」，按前後文義修訂作「layout」。">layout</span> of the literature unearthed from under the
Ningxia's square pagoda. All previous works dealing with the
book producing history only talked about the few ways of
binding book such as <i>Juan zhou, Fang jia, Jing zhe</i>, and <i>Hu 
die</i>,
without mentioning the forms like <i>Zhan ye</i> and <i>Feng hui</i> that
were applied already to the surviving manuscripts found in the
Dunhuang Buddhist Caves. Facing the ancient books, people
tend to question why there were so many binding forms
evolved? Or is there any internal law to be sought for in this
direction? In the editor's point of view, the diversification of
the binding forms was determined by the development of
papermaking technique and skills. As a variety of paper were
being adopted into book making shops, different ways of
binding and layout were also tentatively used in the producing
process, which was manifested in the manuscripts unearthed
from under the Ningxia square pagoda. As an instance, the
manuscripts in <i>Feng hui</i> and other binding ways signify the
correlation between developments of paper and book's binding
technique.

There are many other messages revealed from the literature
discovered in the Ningxia region, and we cannot make
introduction of all of them herein. We leave them to our
readers' judgment.

In the column of &quot;Researching Papers&quot; we took an important
article by Professor Sueki Humihiko (木末文美士). It is titled
&quot;the Formation of Japanese Buddhist Bibliography focused
on the Recordings of Chan Light Passing On in the Eastern
Region&quot; which was formerly a lecture the author gave at the
Researching Section of Buddhology in the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences. The editor considers that this article
provides to Chinese scholars a referring frame in this direction.

One of the Buddhist phrases is all action is transient&quot;. To
some extent, it describes the six years we spent in compiling
<i><strong>the Buddhist Texts Not Contained In the Tripit&#257;ka.</strong></i> During
the period we experienced all kinds of hardship and witnessed
a great alternation of membership in the editorial committee. In
spite of all this situation, we persisted in pushing forward our
cause with some indispensable adjustment. From the very
beginning, we were financed by the Zhi Lian Jing Yuan in
Hong Kong, a Buddhist Community Aspiring for the Pure land.
Without its support, we could not make the first step in this
way. And it is the generous support from the Zhi Lian Jing
Yuan and other groups that we can stick to the editorial work
with painstaking efforts until today. At first, we once had a
naive idea that we could eventually afford sustaining the cause
by the income from selling the Buddhist texts that had been
turned out formerly, and the reality was proved to be opposite
to our anticipation. This time, we are able to succeed in
publishing Book Ⅶ of <i><strong>the Buddhist Texts Not Contained In
the Tripit&#257;ka</strong></i> it is merely owing to the chance provided by
the K&#333;toku ji in Japan and Mr. Wang Jin xiang in Taiwan. We
hereby show our appreciation to them and we hope to be
favored by support and concerns from all walks of life in
future.</p>
