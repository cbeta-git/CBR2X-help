<p class="head">FOREWORD</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">
In the foreword to the first number of our <strong>Buddhist Texts Not Contained 
in the Tripitaka,</strong> I have pointed out that &quot;Here we find, for example, 
all kinds of Buddhist scriptures translated in modern times from Sanskrit, Pali, 
Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.; a great amount of Buddhist texts from the Dunhuang 
Scripture Cave; ancient Buddhist texts which are kept in various libraries and 
museums and have not yet been included in the Tripitakas of the various eras; 
Buddhist materials preserved in dynastic histories, local gazetteers, classified 
reference books and collected works of individual persons; materials on stone 
and bronze inscriptions; Buddhist works and materials of recent dates. All the 
above-mentioned works can be called <strong>
Buddhist texts not contained in the Tripitaka.</strong> &quot;Our first three numbers 
have, relatively speaking, laid stress upon the collation and publication of a 
number of Buddhist texts among the surviving documents from Dunhuang, and the 
fourth to sixth numbers, which we are presenting to our readers, have also 
selected some important Buddhist texts in other areas so that our readers can 
get more detailed knowledge of the so-called <strong>Buddhist Texts Not 
Contained in the Tripitaka.</strong>
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Let me first talk about the Chinese translations of the 
Tibetan Buddhist scriptures. As is well known, Tibetan Buddhism, being one of 
the three major Buddhist systems in China, and Chinese Buddhism have mutually 
influenced each other all the time. According to the history of texts exchanges, 
Tibetan Buddhist texts have exerted influence upon Chinese ones four times. The 
earliest influence occurred during the Tang Dynasty. A number of Tibetan 
Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese in Dunhuang in more than seventy 
years when it was under the reign of ancient Tibet named Tubo. Although the 
number of the translations was not large, they had influenced Dunhuang Buddhism 
greatly. Nevertheless, these texts have not reached the interior of our country, 
and as a result, have not been included into Chinese Tripitakas. Fortunately, 
they have been preserved among the surviving Dunhuang documents. The two texts 
entitled </span> <strong>Yin Yuan Xin Lun Song</strong>
and <strong>Yin Yuan Xin Lun Shi,</strong> which we have published in the third 
number of our <strong>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka,</strong>
just fall into this category. The later influence occurred during the reign of 
the Western Xia, when a good number of Tibetan Buddhist scriptures were 
translated into Chinese. Those Chinese texts mainly spread in the area 
controlled by the Western Xia regime, and therefore have not been included into 
traditional Tripitakas. However, in places where the Western Xia used to be, 
people have repeatedly found some of the texts since modern times. One example 
is the <strong>Ba Zhong Cu Zhong Fan Duo</strong> published in the first number 
of the <strong>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka.</strong>
Obviously, the influences exerted during the above-mentioned two times were 
confined in a very limited area. The following two influences, however, have 
been much farther and wider. The third influence occurred during the Yuan 
Dynasty, when, from the material available now, a small number of Buddhist texts 
were translated into Chinese and included into the Tripitakas. The fourth 
influence occurred in modern times, when the involved texts, in terms of both 
depth and width, have greatly surpassed the first three times. The number of the 
translated texts is about one hundred. Hitherto, they have not been collected 
and sifted completely and systematically. Now, we have selected the text <strong>
Ru Pu Sa Xin Lun Guang Shi</strong> translated by Master Longlian in early 
1950&#39;s and would like to offer it to our readers in the forth number of the
<strong>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka.</strong> 
Master Longlian has excelled as a bhiksuni in contemporary China, and her 
translation has won the final judgment by Mr. Zhao Puchu in his preface to it. 
At present, many people have showed keen interest in Tibetan Tantrism, and quite 
a number of books in this area have been published. However, among them have 
been found various views. We hope that the publication of this text here can 
spur researchers to pay more attention to the studies of the source material of 
Tibetan Buddhism so as to avoid unnecessary errors.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Then come the Chinese translated versions of the 
southern Buddhist scriptures. In ancient times, many a southern Buddhist 
scripture had been translated into Chinese. However, with the decline of 
Buddhism, the translation work had been suspended for centuries. When the <strong>
Puhuizang</strong> was being compiled in 1930&#39;s, they planned to resume the work 
to translate some southern Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Being in short of 
specialized personnel, some southern Buddhist scriptures, which were included 
into the <strong>Puhuizang,</strong> had as a matter of fact been retranslated 
into Chinese from Japanese. Since then, the translation work of the southern 
Buddhist scriptures has become a focal point for the Chinese Buddhist and 
academic circles. Some scriptures such as the
<strong>Fa Ju Jing</strong> and the <strong>Qing Jing Dao Lun</strong> had been 
translated into Chinese. However, this work, on the whole, being frequently off 
and on, had not been really unfolded. The situation has changed somewhat since 
1980&#39;s. The Buddhist circles in Taiwan have been engaged in translating the 
southern Buddhist scriptures from Japanese while the Buddhist scholars in the 
mainland have made efforts to translate the scriptures directly from the 
original Pali texts. What is especially worth mentioning is Prof. Deng 
Dianchen&#39;s great determination and dedication to the cause, into which he had 
devoted all his efforts. And he had meticulously translated a group of southern 
Buddhist scriptures. While we were very delighted to see that the southern 
Buddhist scriptures had been continuously put into Chinese we learned the sad 
news that Prof. Deng had passed away because of constant overworking. His death 
was a great loss to our cause. Shortly before his death, Prof. Deng and I had 
agreed to publish his translations in the
<strong>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka.</strong> 
While I was paying my last respects to him I made up my mind in silence to try 
my best to publish the scriptures that Prof. Deng had translated into Chinese. 
Now, this wish has come true with the energetic support form Mrs. Zhao Tong, 
Professor Deng&#39;s wife. The 
<strong>Xiao Song,</strong> the <strong>Ji Xing Zi Shuo</strong> and the 
<strong>Da Sui Dao Ben Sheng,</strong> 
which are published in the fifth number of the <strong>Buddhist Texts Not 
Contained in the Tripitaka,</strong> are all Prof. Deng&#39;s posthumous works, and 
the Da Nian Chu Jing has been jointly translated by Prof. Deng and Mrs. Zhao. In 
addition, the <strong>Da Sui Dao Ben Sheng Jing Zhuan</strong> translated by 
Prof. Deng has been published and included into the <strong>
&quot;Library of Dharma Voice&quot;</strong> by the Chinese Buddhist Association, and his <strong>
Zhang Lao Ji</strong> and <strong>Zhang Lao Ni Ji</strong>
have also been put into one book and published by the Chinese Social Sciences 
Publishing House. At present, a group of young monks in Chinese Buddhist circles 
have been greatly interested in initial Buddhism, and expect to find ways from 
early Buddhism to cure some maladies in contemporary Buddhist circles. We hope 
that the translations of the southern Buddhist scriptures can be helpful to 
their exploration.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">What has extremely delighted us is that we are able to 
offer a group of scriptures of the Azhali Sect in Yunnan to our readers.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The Buddhist Azhali Sect is popular in Dali and some 
other areas in Yunnan. This has been a well-known fact for a long time. 
Nevertheless, as to which system this Azhali Sect actually belongs to, people 
have voiced various opinions. Some think that it belongs to the system of Indian 
Tantrism; some feel that it belongs to the system of Tibetan Buddhism; others 
hold that it is the result of the naturalization of Indian Tantrism, and 
therefore name it as &quot;Yunnan Tantrism.&quot; In a word, although people are still 
unable to define it properly, they generally attribute it to Tantrism. A few 
years ago, Prof. Lan Jifu from Taiwan, after his on-the-spot investigation 
there, pointed out that &quot;the relationships between the Azhali Sect and Tantrism 
has to be reassessed. It would be imprecise to indiscreetly equate the Azhali 
Sect with the Tang Dynasty Tantrism during the reign period named Kaiyuan 
(713-741) or Japanese and Tibetan Tantrism.&quot; (Yunnan Dali De Azhali Jiao, 
Zhongguo Fojiao Fanlun, Xin Wen Feng Publishing Company, August 1993, p. 5) He 
thought that &quot;the Azhali belief is still the magic belief at the mixed period of 
Tantrism...It seems to be just the show of the outer casting of Tantrism, and 
has not yet absorbed the kernel connotation of Tantrism...The doctrine of the 
Azhali Sect has mainly come from hinterland Buddhism of China.&quot; (ibid., p. 71) 
He has indicated a new orientation for the studies of the Azhali Sect. Mr. Hou 
Chong, who works with the Institute of Religious Studies, the Yunnan Social 
Sciences Academy, has collected a large amount of the scriptures of the Azhali 
Sect after long-termed painstaking efforts. He has put forth on the basis of his 
rich material that the Azhali Sect is not equal to Tantrism as our predecessors 
have stated. On the contrary, it is in fact the vestiges of the &#39;religious&#39; sect 
that occurred and migrated to Yunnan in early Ming Dynasty. In another word, the 
so-called Azhali Sect is, as a matter of fact, a living fossil of the 
&quot;religious&quot; sect in the Ming Dynasty. Of course, the living fossil here means to 
stress that the origin of the Azhali Sect can be traced back to the &quot;religious&quot; 
sect in the Ming Dynasty. By saying so, we do not mean that the Azhali Sect is 
identical with the &quot;religious&quot; sect in the Ming Dynasty and had not undergone 
any changes. All dharmas are changeable, and nothing can remain intact in the 
world. For instance, it is a great change for a layman to work for the Azhali 
Sect at present. In a word, Mr. Hou&#39;s research has cleared all kinds of doubts 
and helped us gain completely new knowledge of Azhali Sect, though there is 
still many an aspect in his research work for him to improve and perfect.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">It is also significant for Mr. Hou to prove once again 
in his work that it is of great importance to try to gain firsthand information 
in scientific research. That people had various impractical opinions on the 
Azhali Sect before was mainly due to their lack of source material and their 
satisfaction with copying and citing some secondhand information. Mr. Lan made 
on-the-spot investigation and yet, confined by conditions, was unable to 
practically see many Azhali scriptures. However, just by the catalogs of partial 
Azhali scriptures and other material he had come across, he keenly found out 
that the before-going viewpoints were mistaken. The key for Mr. Hou to discover 
what others had not is his investigation, obtainment and collation of a large 
amount of Azhali scriptures that our predecessors had not seen. What we publish 
in the sixth number of our <strong>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</strong> 
is just a part of them. We do hope that this kind of style of study, which 
attaches importance to source material, can be carried forward in reality. At 
the same time, we also hope that various working places that collect and store 
documents can inherit the good tradition to regard &quot;learning as a public 
business under the heaven,&quot; and make due contributions to the development of 
Chinese academic and cultural causes.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Stone inscriptions have always been a very important 
part of Buddhist material. The content of stone inscriptions has been pretty 
rich and full, covering tablet inscriptions, tablet records of statue 
construction and scriptures carved on stone blocks, etc.. Ancient monks once 
paid exceptional attention to the collection and utilization of the material. 
For instance, almost all the biographies of the monks in the past ages made wide 
use of the stone inscriptions. In the fourth number of the <strong>Buddhist 
Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka,</strong> we publish a group of the stone 
inscriptions from Dazu, Sichuan. The Dazu Grottoes opened up in the Song Dynasty 
are among the famous Chinese grottoes. All the carved scriptures, hymns and 
statues have offered important material for us to get to know and make studies 
of the then Buddhism. The Dazu stone inscriptions published in the fourth number 
of the <strong>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka,</strong> 
for instance, have clearly reflected the features of the then Buddhism: to 
encourage people to do good and punish evil-doers by the concept of retribution; 
to win over people by advocating filial duty; and to call on people to get 
salvation from other forces so as to obtain their deliverance, which are just 
the three most fundamental characteristics of the popularized Chinese Buddhism 
or Buddhism in the nature of belief.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Collating Buddhist texts from the surviving Dunhuang 
books has become a distinguishing feature of the <strong>Buddhist Texts Not 
Contained in the Tripitaka.</strong> Since our three numbers from the fourth to 
the sixth have included a lot of non-Dunhuang material, we have to reduce the 
scope for Dunhuang material and can only publish five texts concerned. The 
fourth number also publishes two pieces of material regarding the Sanjie Sect. 
One of them is entitled <strong>Fo Xing Wen Da,</strong> 
discovered in the Beijing Library in recent years, and we have specially 
requested Mr. Ye Luhua to collate it. Since there are more nonstandard forms of 
Chinese characters used in Dunhuang in the text, and we lack any collated texts 
for us to check against, we can not say for certain that we have identified all 
the Chinese characters without any mistakes, though we have rectified the text 
repeatedly and have also consulted some experts in philology. We, therefore, 
request our readers to point out any mistakes they may find. Another text 
entitled <strong>Da Cheng Wu Jin Zang Fa</strong> is an early work by Xinxing. 
The Japanese scholar 矢吹慶輝 once named it as &quot;Posthumous Work by Xinxing&quot; and 
included it into the <strong>Sanjiejiao Yanjiu</strong> 
as its material. Now it has been collated once again according to some 
newly-found material. <strong>The Ru Lai Zai Jin Guan Zhu Lei Qing Jing Zhuang 
Yan Jing Fu Jing</strong> is a &quot;doubtful and spurious work&quot; written by a 
Chinese, and we have collated it on the basis of some surviving Dunhuang books 
and some stone inscription material. The said text emphasizes particularly that 
one must write a scripture or build a statue according to dharma; it can also 
reflect the great efforts the monks in the Northern and Southern Dynasties had 
made to correct the maladies of the times. I think that it is of certain 
significance for every collator of the Dunhuang Buddhist literature to learn 
something from this. The Dunhuang Buddhist texts in the three said numbers also 
include <strong>the Yu Jia Shi Di Kai Shi Fen Men Ji</strong> in the fifth 
number and <strong>the Jin Xin Yi Da Fang Guang Fo Hua Yan Jing Biao (Fu Zong 
Mu)</strong> in the sixth number.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Each number from the fourth to the sixth publishes a 
research paper. Mr. Chen Jinhua&#39;s paper entitled <strong>Chuan Shanwuwei Suo Yi 
San Bu Mijiao Yigui Chuchu Ji Niandai Kao</strong> is an abridged version of his 
doctoral dissertation. With a vast amount of evidences and tight logic, he 
points out in his dissertation that the three Tantric scriptures are in fact not 
translated by Shanwuwei, but by a Japanese monk of the Tiantai Sect, though the 
translation of them has traditionally been attributed to the former. Since this 
has involved a series of vital matters with both the Tiantai and the Tantric 
Sects in Japanese Buddhism, I am sure that it should interest our readers. Mr. 
Hou has listed more than fifty personally collected texts belonging to the 
Azhali Sect in his paper entitled <strong>
Yunnan Azhalijiao Jingdian Ji Qi Zai Zhongguo Fojiao Zhong De Yanjiu Jiazhi,</strong> 
and he has also briefly talked about his latest viewpoints on the studies of the 
Yunnan Azhali Sect. We therefore have attached it as an appendix to the texts of 
the Azhali Sect published in our sixth number. As for my paper entitled <strong>
Tiantai Jiaodian Ruzang Kao,</strong> I have to say that it aims at probing the 
catalog structure of the <strong>Kaibaozang,</strong> though the object I have 
examined is the inclusion of the scriptures of the Tiantai Sect into the 
Tripitaka. Since I have made an appointment with Mr. 緒方香州, a Japanese scholar, 
to cooperate with each other in the program of studying and restoring the 
original catalog of the <strong>Kaibaozang,</strong> this paper is in fact a 
partial result of the above-mentioned research.
</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The third number of <strong>the Buddhist Texts Not 
Contained in the Tripitaka</strong> was published in March, 1997. Since then, 
our readers have kept inquiring for information about the publication of the 
following numbers. According to the original plan that one new number was to be 
published by the editorial board every six months, we should have published the 
fourth number in 1997. However, as what we have said above, the editorial 
process has been different from before and has been delayed, for the majority of 
the organized contributions are not provided by our editors. Finally, we decide 
to publish simultaneously the contributions in the fourth to sixth numbers as a 
whole. In this way, we have basically kept pace with our original plan. From now 
on, we shall try our best to publish one number every six months, if our funds 
can be guaranteed and no other special matters occur unexpectedly. In terms of 
the content, in addition to publishing continuously some of the collated texts 
of the Azhali Sect, we shall still lay stress on the collation of the Dunhuang 
surviving books.
