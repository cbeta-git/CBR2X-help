<p class="body_margin-4">Ever since the 
beginning of the modern times, a fresh upsurge in compiling the Dazangjing (or Tats&#39;angching) has been ushered 
in with the deepening of people&#39;s knowledge of Buddhism. And while the 
electronic publication is
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「develping」，按前後文義修訂作「developing」。">
developing</span> rapidly nowadays, the appeal for editing
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「aphotoelectric」，按前後文義修訂作「a photoelectric」。">
a photoelectric</span> edition of the Dazangjing, at home and abroad, has become 
more and more powerful. Under such circumstances, the Bureau of Religious 
Affairs of the State Council presided over a &quot;Symposium on the Compilation of 
the Dazangjing and Its <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「Compu terization」，按前後文義修訂作「Computerization」。">
Computerization</span>&quot; (&quot;Symposium on the Dazangjing 
Project&quot;) in Beijing from April 9 to 10, 1996. Present at the 
conference were nearly 40
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「emi nent」，按前後文義修訂作「eminent」。">eminent</span> 
experts and monks from both the academic and religious circles in Beijing. The 
participants spoke out freely and, from various angles, proved up to the hilt 
the importance, necessity and feasibility of compiling a new Dazangjing which 
would be able to embody the supreme learning level of the Chinese nation. The 
convening of this important meeting marked the beginning of a new historical 
period in the undertakings of compiling the Dazangjing. And since to serve the 
compilation of the Dazangjing is the fundamental aim of our <i>Buddhist Texts 
Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>, we editors here would like to warmly 
congratulate the participants on the successful convention of this symposium. 
With the agreement of the sponsor of the symposium, we have here selected 11 
papers by the participants and edited the remainder speeches and papers given at 
the symposium as &quot;Excerpts of Speeches.&quot; By arranging all this as a special 
issue in the second number of our book, we expect that personages of various 
social circles could pay close attention to this event and join the discussion. 
According to the layout of our
<i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i>, research papers, as a 
rule, are arranged behind the Buddhist literature itself. However, it is clear 
that such an event as the Symposium on the Dazangjing Project should draw wider 
attention and support from people; there fore, we put this group of papers at 
the beginning of this number of our book. It is worth mentioning that an 
international academic symposium on the same topic was also convened at the 
Foguangshan Hill in Taiwan in the first <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「tenday」，按前後文義修訂作「ten-day」。">
ten-day</span> period of last April. All this proves fully that the 
international community as well as both sides of the Taiwan Straits are very 
concerned with this great cause.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The main 
contents of the second number of <i>the Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the 
Tripitaka</i> are as follows:</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The column &quot;Chan 
Texts from Dunhuang&quot; of this number publish two Chan texts from Dunhuang, viz. <i>
the Qizu Fabao Ji</i> and the <i>Tianzhuguo Putidamo Chanshi Lun</i>.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>The Qizu 
Fabao Ji</i> is such a peculiar Chan text that the whole of it is composed of 
quotations and citations, and is therefore equal to the <i>Zhu Jing Yao Ji</i>. 
Previously, people all said that China&#39;s Chan School &quot;has not followed any sutra 
or abhidharma, and has no written works.&quot; Nevertheless, <i>the Qizu Fabao Ji</i> 
is not <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「noly」，按前後文義修訂作「only」。">only</span> 
a written work, but also has followed some sutras and abhidharmas. As a matter 
of fact, the author put forth and proved his own doctrine upon the basis of some 
scriptures throughout the text. It was never recorded before and has been 
discovered in the Beijing <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「Lib rary」，按前後文義修訂作「Library」。">
Library</span> of late. NO.1 of the two parts of the text has been preserved in 
the Beijing Library since it was brought to the city from Dun huang, and has 
failed to be appraised and published; another number of the text had once 
drifted outside and was finally under the care of the same library, and has been 
kept there up to now. Originally, both numbers were of the same fascicle, and it 
is to be regretted that some parts in between have been missing, and therefore 
they cannot be straightly joined together. The colophon at the end of the second 
number names it as the &quot;xiajuan&quot; 
(&quot;concluded fascicle&quot;, viz. the second of two or the last of three, according to 
the layout characteristics of Chinese publications) of the text; 
therefore, the original work should have two or three fascicles. And it is hard 
to identify who this Qizu (the Seventh Guru) was now. 
However, it seems to me that he should belong to the Northern Chan School, 
according to the ideological inclination in the text. <i>The Tianzhuguo Putidamo 
Chanshi Lun</i> 
has already been published in the first number of <i>the Buddhist Texts Not 
Contained in the Tripitaka</i>. As the explanatory note on the title of the text 
therein says, it is commonplace for Buddhist scriptures to be supplemented with 
new contents or undergo transmutation while being copied. If any different 
versions of a text do appear during its <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「dissmimation」，按前後文義修訂作「dissemination」。">
dissemination</span>, these versions should be collated respectively. However, 
it is <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「re latively」，按前後文義修訂作「relatively」。">
relatively</span> 
complicated whether some texts should be regarded as the different versions. 
Consequently, after the different versions of the text have been edited and 
merged into one in the first number of our book, we are here to collate its two 
different versions <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「in dividually」，按前後文義修訂作「individually」。">
individually</span> in this very number, which is in our opinion a new 
experiment in collating such texts. We sincerely welcome any <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「cri ticism」，按前後文義修訂作「criticism」。">
criticism</span> in this aspect.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The column 
&quot;Commentaries on the Tripitaka&quot; brings forth two texts: <i>the Jing Ming Jing Ji 
Jie Guan Zhong Shu</i> 
and <i>the Fa Hua Jing Wen Wai Yi</i>.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4"><i>The Jing Ming 
Jing Ji Jie Guan Zhong Shu</i>, collected by <i>Daoye</i> in the Tang Dynasty (618907), is a comparatively 
important one of the extant commentaries on <i>Vimalakirtinirdesasutra</i>. A 
number of <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「ver sions」，按前後文義修訂作「versions」。">
versions</span> of this commentary have been found among the surviving books 
from Dunhuang. It drew research workers&#39; attention long ago and has been 
collected into the 85th volume of <i>the Dazhengzang</i>. Unfortunately, the 
commentary included in <i>the Dazhengzang</i> lacked accurate and comprehensive 
collation, and more than 10 thousand Chinese
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「charac ters」，按前後文義修訂作「characters」。">
characters</span> from the latter half of the fifth Pin
(chapter) to the 
first half of the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「sventh」，按前後文義修訂作「seventh」。">
seventh</span> pin have been missing; therefore, the publication of the collated 
text here is in fact the first time for the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「com plete」，按前後文義修訂作「complete」。">
complete</span> 
text of the commentary to see the light of day. The <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「commen tary」，按前後文義修訂作「commentary」。">
commentary</span>, consisting of two fascicles, is fairly <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「lenghthy」，按前後文義修訂作「lengthy」。">
lengthy</span>. As a result of the limited space of this number, we now just 
bring forth the first fascicle, and the second one will come into being in the 
third number of our book.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Also sifted out 
from the
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「suriving」，按前後文義修訂作「surviving」。">surviving</span> 
books from Dunhuang is <i>the Fa Hua Jing Wen Wai Yi</i>, a commentary on <i>the 
Fahuajing </i> (<i>Saddharmapunda rikasutra</i>). 
The author of this text is unknown, for he has never been recorded in any 
catalogs of the Buddhist Canon through the ages. The
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「origional」，按前後文義修訂作「original」。">original</span> 
text is now kept in the Shanghai Museum. As the title of the text suggests, it 
lays no stress on straightening out the words and phrases of <i>the Fahuajing</i>. 
Instead, drawing forth a number of questions from <i>the Fahuajiing</i>, the 
author gave them <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「spe cific」，按前後文義修訂作「specific」。">
specific</span> 
expositions in his text, from which one can get a hint of the major questions 
and theoretical tendencies with regard to the then studies of <i>the Fahuajing</i>. 
Copied in 545 A.D. during the reign of the Western Wei Dynasty, the manuscript 
has preserved considerable ancient forms of Chinese characters used in the 
period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and the wording and phrasing 
therein are slightly of colloquial flavor; therefore, it is of a certain value 
to any one who makes studies of the then languages and characters.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The section 
&quot;Important Texts from India&quot; publishes <i>the Di Yi Zheng De Jing</i>, a 
principal Indian Jain scripture in.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Jainism, the <span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「socalled」，按前後文義修訂作「so-called」。">
so-called</span> &quot;Niganth cult&quot; in the Buddhist texts, is still one of the very 
influential religious sects in India today. Jainism and Buddhism emerged in the 
same age and same place, and had followers of roughly identical social levels. 
As a result, both religions share many a common or similar point in their 
doctrines. To study Jainism is a must for any one who studies Buddhism, 
especially the early Buddhism, which has become a common understanding in the 
Buddhist research circles in the world. It is a pity that no one in China has 
ever translated a Jain scripture into Chinese in the past two thousand years 
except for some introduction in the Buddhist scriptures. Among the numerous Jain 
scriptures, only the Di Yi Zheng De Jing is one jointly revered and followed by 
two great sects, viz. the Svetambara and the Digambara, and it is also publicly 
accepted as the most essential text dealing with the Jain doctrine, hence the 
translated version here. China&#39;s Buddhists have had the tradition to collect 
India&#39;s cultic texts into the Dazang jing, such as <i>Chen Zhendi&#39;</i>s
<span class="corr" title="CBETA 編按：原書作「traslation」，按前後文義修訂作「translation」。">
translation</span> of <i>the Suvarnasaptati Sastra</i>, a work of ancient 
India&#39;s Samkhya School, and the Tang monk <i>Xuan zang&#39;</i>s translation of <i>
Dasapadarthasastra</i>, a work of ancient India&#39;s Vaisesika School, etc.. 
Following this tradition, we have included this <i>Di Yi Zheng De Jing</i> into 
our <i>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</i> to offer it to our 
readers.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">The section 
&quot;Lost Pearls Regained&quot; brings forth <i>the Yu Jia Shi Di Lun Pi Xun Ji Xu</i>, 
an important research paper by Mr. Han Qing jing, a distinguished Buddhist 
scholar in modern times, in his later years.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Tracing his own 
academic experience throughout his life in this paper, Mr. Han Qingjing expounds 
the significance of <i>the Yogacara bhumi Sastra</i> in &quot;carrying forward the 
essentials of authentic Buddhism.&quot; Therefore, this paper can serve as important 
reference material for one to make studies of Mr. Han Qingjing&#39;s thinking. In 
addition, the author points out in his paper that there are many errors in 
writing in the Sanskrit original of <i>the Yogacarabhumi Sastra</i>. This really 
deserves our great attention, for the author has corrected the mistakes passed 
on for more than one thousand years. It is indeed delighting and amazing for 
this important paper to be published for the first time after it has gone 
through all kinds of disasters.</p>
<p class="body_margin-4">Dazangjing, an 
accumulation of China&#39;s Buddhist essences through generations, is a cultural 
treasure that we Chinese people have contributed to the world. Since the 
Northern and Southern Dynasties, all the successive dynasties in China had 
maintained two traditions: one was to compile the Dazangjing, another one was to 
write the official history, forming two grand humanistic views in parallel with 
each other in China&#39;s history. Our country is now in its heyday again. If we can 
compile a new Dazangjing, we shall be able to benefit generation after 
generation. We sincerely hope that we Chinese people at home and abroad, the 
peoples of the countries in the Chinese Buddhist cultural sphere, and personages 
of the Buddhist and academic circles, can all join hands and dedicate our selves 
to the cause of compiling a new Dazangjing that can include our present 
accomplishments and set a fine example for posterity.</p>
